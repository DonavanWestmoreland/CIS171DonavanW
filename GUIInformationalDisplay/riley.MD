# Grading Notes

Thank you for loading entire project to GitHub.
This enables me to easily test.

repo should be named last name first initial, so it will sort in the order of the gradebook.

Instructions on using the readme with an image are posted to the announcements in Canvas. Your readme looks 
good except for the image - it is easy.
