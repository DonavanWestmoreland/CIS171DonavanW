# Exercise 16.13

a simple program to create a loan calculator with a GUI

If you run it youll notice that it look different from the image. Thats because when i tried to push it it reverted my project to a previous stage and forced me to start over from scratch.

## Example Output

## Analysis Steps

*16.13 (Compare loans with various interest rates) Rewrite Programming Exercise 5.21 to create a GUI, as shown in Figure 16.41b. Your program should let the user enter the loan amount and loan period in the number of years from text fields, and it should display the monthly and total payments for each interest rate starting from 5 percent to 8 percent, with increments of one-eighth, in a text area.
