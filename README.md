# Project Title

a project that displays the runtimes of multiple different sort algorithms

## Example Output


![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps
Complete the following application as the hands-on portion of Exam 3.  You may use your previously written code as a reference to complete this project.  Internet is allowed.  

Write a program that obtains the execution time of selection sort, radix sort, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort for input size 50000, 100,000, 150,000, 200,000, 250,000, and 300,000. Your program should create data randomly and print a table.


long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

perform the task;long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

long executionTime = endTime - startTime;

### Design

slowly testing each piece bit by bit sos everyhting worked together
### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

## Notes

Explain any issues or testing instructions.
