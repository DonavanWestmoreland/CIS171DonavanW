Analysis:
Problem- to create a program the randomly generates 1s and 0s and places them in a 10 by 10 grid
input- none
output- a 10 by 10 grid witha random 1 or 0 inside of the boxes

Design:
took me forever to figure out that i needed a nested for loop. Without the for loop it would only print out a diagonal line of 
1s and 0s rather than a grid. The rest was just a simple box setup and importing the random number class java already had.

Testing:
Trying a whole bunch of random bits of code to figure out the nested for loop. THe for loop was honestly the hardest part of this to figure out
