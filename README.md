## JavaII Submission Repository

Still not clear on how to submit these without the program submission doc


Analysis:
the problem was to create a informational display in java fx
input- nothing that i can think of
output- button,image,text, heading

Design:
the major problems i encountered were setting locations and everything as you will probably see when or if ou run it.

Testing;
going bit byt and testing just to get one peice working one at a time.

I dont know how to put the screenshots into the github readME
